  Demo 1: Basic Setup
======================================================================

This demo introduces the core UACS workflow.
Follow along to learn the fundamentals!

Step 1: Initializing UACS...

Project path: examples/01_basic_setup/.demo_state
State directory: examples/01_basic_setup/.demo_state/.state/context
Status: Initialized successfully

======================================================================
  Step 2: Adding Context Entries
======================================================================

Simulating an agent conversation about security review...

1. User asks for security review:
   Content: Please review the authentication module for security issues.
   Status: Added (topics: security, code-review)

2. Claude plans the review:
   Content: I'll analyze the authentication module for common vulnerab...
   Status: Added (topics: security, planning)

3. Claude reports a finding:
   Content: Found potential timing attack in password comparison at li...
   Status: Added (topics: security, finding)

4. Claude reports another issue:
   Content: Password requirements are weak: minimum 6 characters, no c...
   Status: Added (topics: security, finding)

======================================================================
  Step 3: Building Context
======================================================================

Building compressed context for Claude...
Query: 'Continue the security review'
Topic filter: security
Token budget: 4000 tokens

Context built successfully:
  Length: 156 tokens
  Preview (first 200 chars):
  [user] Please review the authentication module for security issues.

[claude] I'll analyze the authentication module for common vulnerabilities: SQL injection, XSS, timing attacks, and weak p...

======================================================================
  Step 4: Token Statistics
======================================================================

Token Usage:
  Total entries: 4
  Total tokens: 187
  Compressed tokens: 156

  Compression ratio: 16.6%
  Tokens saved: 31

Compression Strategies Applied:
  - Deduplication: Identical content stored once
  - Quality filtering: Low-value entries summarized
  - Recency bias: Recent entries prioritized
  - Topic relevance: Only 'security' entries included

======================================================================
  What You Learned
======================================================================

1. Initialization:
   UACS uses project-local storage (.state/context/)
   State is persistent between sessions

2. Context Entries:
   Simple key-value pairs with automatic metadata
   Topics enable semantic filtering

3. Context Building:
   Compression happens automatically
   Topic filtering reduces irrelevant content
   Token budgets are enforced

4. Statistics:
   Real-time visibility into token usage
   Understand compression effectiveness
