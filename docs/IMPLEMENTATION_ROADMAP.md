# UACS Implementation Roadmap

**THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR UNIVERSAL AGENT CONTEXT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT**

**Last Updated: December 27, 2025**

---

## 📋 How to Use This Roadmap

**This roadmap is designed for human-AI collaboration:**

### Structure
- **Phase** = Major milestone (e.g., "Phase 2: MCP Server Standalone Packaging")
- **Stage** = Group of related tasks
  - **SEQUENTIAL** ⚡ = Must complete before next stage starts
  - **PARALLEL** 🔄 = Tasks can run simultaneously
- **Task** = Specific work for one agent (human or AI)

### Using Tasks as AI Agent Prompts

**Each task section is self-contained and can be copied directly to an AI agent:**

1. **Find the task** you want to work on (e.g., "🤖 Agent 1 Task: Setup PyInstaller Infrastructure")

2. **Copy the entire task section** including:
   - Time estimate
   - Context explanation
   - Mission statement
   - Detailed tasks with code examples
   - Deliverables checklist
   - Validation steps

3. **Paste to your AI agent** (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) with this template:
   ```
   I'm working on the UACS project. Here's my task:
   
   [PASTE TASK SECTION HERE]
   
   Please help me implement this. Ask questions if anything is unclear.
   ```

4. **Review and iterate** - The agent will ask clarifying questions and generate code

5. **Mark task complete** when validation steps pass

### Multi-Agent Workflow

For phases with multiple agents:
1. **Coordinator** (you) assigns tasks to agents
2. **Agents work in parallel** on independent tasks
3. **Sync at stage boundaries** - all agents must finish current stage before moving to next
4. **Final integration** by coordinator at end of phase

## Phase 2: MCP Server Standalone Packaging

**Goal:** Enable non-Python users to run MCP server without Python installation

### Understanding Phases, Stages, and Tasks

**This roadmap is structured for multi-agent collaboration:**

#### 📦 Phase
A major milestone that delivers a complete feature or capability.
- Example: "Phase 2: MCP Server Standalone Packaging"
- Duration: Multiple stages (hours to weeks)
- Has clear success criteria and deliverables

#### 🔄 Stage
A logical group of related tasks that forms one step in completing a phase.
- **SEQUENTIAL** ⚡ = All tasks in stage must complete before next stage begins
- **PARALLEL** 🔄 = Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different tasks
- Duration: Few hours to a few days
- Example: "Stage 1: Foundation Setup" → "Stage 2: Platform Builds"

#### ✅ Task
A specific, self-contained work item assigned to one agent.
- Labeled as "🤖 Agent X Task: [Name]"
- Includes full context, instructions, code examples, and validation
- Can be copy-pasted as a complete prompt to an AI agent
- Duration: 30 minutes to 4 hours per task

#### Visual Flow Example:

```
Phase 2: MCP Server Standalone Packaging
│
├─ Stage 1: Foundation Setup (SEQUENTIAL ⚡) [[KB: Be clearer, so agent 1, 2, and 3 need to run sequential or they can be run parallel just before moving to Stage 2?]]
│  ├─ Agent 1: PyInstaller setup (2-3h) ─┐
│  ├─ Agent 2: Docker setup (2-3h) ──────┤─→ All complete
│  └─ Agent 3: Doc templates (2h) ───────┘   before Stage 2
│                                             starts
├─ Stage 2: Platform Builds (PARALLEL 🔄)
│  ├─ Agent 1: Multi-platform binaries (5-7h) ──┐
│  ├─ Agent 2: Docker optimization (3-4h) ──────┤─→ Work
│  └─ Agent 3: Test infrastructure (3-4h) ──────┘   simultaneously
│
├─ Stage 3: Integration Testing (PARALLEL 🔄)
│  └─ ... continues
│
└─ Stage 5: Final Integration
   └─ Coordinator reviews and approves
```

**Key Insight:** Tasks within a PARALLEL stage can run at the same time, but you must complete all tasks in a stage before moving to the next SEQUENTIAL stage.

---

### Team Structure for Phase 2

**4 people working in parallel:**
- **Agent 1:** PyInstaller binary builds (specialist in cross-platform compilation)
- **Agent 2:** Docker packaging (specialist in containerization)
- **Agent 3:** Documentation & testing (specialist in QA and technical writing)
- **You:** Coordination, uvx testing, and final integration

**Dependencies:** Each stage must complete before the next stage begins, but tasks within a stage can run in parallel.

---

### Stage 1: Foundation Setup - **SEQUENTIAL** ⚡

**What:** Set up build infrastructure for binaries, Docker, and documentation templates.

**Why:** These foundation pieces must exist before we can build platform-specific artifacts.

**Duration:** 2-3 hours per agent (can work in parallel, but stage completes when all agents finish)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Build scripts exist and run
- ✅ Basic binary and Docker image can be created
- ✅ Documentation structure is ready

---

#### 🤖 Agent 1 Task: Setup PyInstaller Infrastructure

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**Context:** We need to create standalone binaries of the UACS MCP server for users who don't have Python installed. PyInstaller packages Python applications into executables.

**Your Mission:** Create the build system for generating cross-platform binaries.

**Tasks:**

1. **Create `scripts/build_mcp_server.py` build script** (1 hour)
   - Set up PyInstaller configuration
   - Configure spec file with these settings:
     ```python
     # Hidden imports needed for MCP server
     hiddenimports = [
         'uacs.protocols.mcp',
         'uacs.adapters',
         'uacs.context',
         'uacs.marketplace',
         'anyio._backends._asyncio',
     ]
     ```
   - Add data files if UACS needs any (check `src/uacs/` for non-Python files)
   - Add platform detection (macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64)
   - Add command-line args: `--platform <platform>`

2. **Test basic build locally** (30 min)
   - Run: `uv run python scripts/build_mcp_server.py`
   - Verify it creates `dist/uacs` or `dist/uacs.exe`
   - Check file size (should be < 50MB)

3. **Verify binary works** (15 min)
   - Run: `./dist/uacs --version`
   - Run: `./dist/uacs serve` (should start MCP server)
   - Test a basic MCP request

4. **Document build process** (30 min)
   - Create `scripts/README.md` with:
     - Prerequisites (uv, Python 3.11+)
     - Build command examples
     - Troubleshooting common issues

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `scripts/build_mcp_server.py` - Working build script
- [ ] `scripts/README.md` - Build documentation
- [ ] `dist/uacs` - Test binary that runs successfully

**Validation:** Run `./dist/uacs serve` and it starts without errors.

---

#### 🤖 Agent 2 Task: Setup Docker Infrastructure [[KB: I'm curious why we are doing this at all right now. This seems like overkill and slowing us down for release.]]

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**Context:** We need a Docker image so users can run the UACS MCP server in a container without installing Python or dependencies.

**Your Mission:** Create optimized Docker configuration for the MCP server.

**Tasks:**

1. **Create `Dockerfile.mcp-server` with Alpine base** (1 hour)
   ```dockerfile
   # Multi-stage build
   FROM python:3.11-alpine AS builder
   # Install build dependencies
   RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev
   # Install UACS
   COPY . /app
   WORKDIR /app
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir .
   
   # Runtime stage
   FROM python:3.11-alpine
   # Copy only what's needed
   COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
   COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin/uacs /usr/local/bin/uacs
   # Set entry point
   ENTRYPOINT ["uacs"]
   CMD ["serve"]
   ```
   - Optimize layer caching
   - Remove unnecessary files
   - Target: < 100MB final image

2. **Create `.dockerignore` file** (15 min)
   ```
   __pycache__
   *.pyc
   .git
   .pytest_cache
   htmlcov
   dist
   build
   ```

3. **Test basic build** (30 min)
   - Run: `docker build -f Dockerfile.mcp-server -t uacs:test .`
   - Check image size: `docker images uacs:test`
   - Verify it's < 100MB

4. **Verify container runs** (15 min)
   - Run: `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 uacs:test serve`
   - Test MCP connection on port 3000

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `Dockerfile.mcp-server` - Optimized multi-stage Dockerfile
- [ ] `.dockerignore` - Files to exclude from build
- [ ] Docker image < 100MB

**Validation:** Run `docker run --rm uacs:test serve` and it starts without errors.

---

#### 🤖 Agent 3 Task: Documentation Preparation

**Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**Context:** We need documentation templates ready so they can be filled in as builds and tests complete.

**Your Mission:** Create structured documentation templates for binary and Docker installations.

## Appendix: Decision Log

### Version Number Decision (Phase 3.3)

**Options:**
- `v1.0.0` - Signals production-ready, API stability
- `v0.1.0` - Signals new package, allows breaking changes

**Recommendation:** `v0.1.0` initially, bump to `v1.0.0` after 1-2 months of stability

**Rationale:**
- Gives buffer for API refinement based on user feedback
- Common practice for new open source projects
- Can iterate faster without semantic versioning constraints

### MCP Server Distribution (Phase 2)

**Decision:** Support all distribution methods
1. **PyPI** - Primary for Python users
2. **uvx** - Simplest one-liner
3. **Docker** - Containerized deployment
4. **Binaries** - Non-Python users

**Rationale:** Different audiences need different distribution methods. Cost is low to support all.

### CLI Code Sharing with MAOS (Phase 0)

**Decision:** UACS CLI commands are importable Typer sub-apps

**Rationale:**
- Zero duplication (single source of truth)
- Both `uacs` and `multi-agent` CLIs work identically
- Natural dependency flow (MAOS depends on UACS)
- Updates propagate via version bump

---

## Related Projects

### Multi-Agent CLI (MAOS)
- **Repository:** `github.com/kylebrodeur/multi-agent-cli`
- **Relationship:** MAOS uses UACS for context management
- **Status:** Phase 7 (ADK-Native Agent Platform)
- **Documentation:** See MAOS `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`

### Integration Points
- MAOS imports UACS as external package: `from uacs import UACS`
- MAOS CLI imports UACS sub-apps: `from uacs.cli import skills, context`
- MAOS orchestrator uses UACS context compression
- MAOS plugins use UACS adapters
